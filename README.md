Vector
------
A Vector is a specialisation of an array which hides the internal layout and function. This allows for the array storage to be fixed size, dynamic size, and/or dynamic capacity as desired on a case-by-case basis.

* Vector can be of a fixed size e.g. **Vector3f**
* Vector can be of dynamic size e.g. **VectorN10f**
* Vector can be of dynamic size and capacity e.g. **VectorXf**
